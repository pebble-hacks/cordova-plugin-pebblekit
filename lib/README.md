#cordova-plugin-pebblekit

Create native companion applications for Pebble smartwatches using PebbleKit for 
[Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

No need for Java or Objective C to create mobile apps that communicate with your
Pebble application.  Use one framework and the vast set of existing Cordova
[plugins](https://cordova.apache.org/plugins/) to extend the functionality of
your watch app/face.
